## android emulator with vs code
1) To  connect android emulator with vscode first install Android ios emulator extension
2) Go to android/sdk/emullator ,right click and then click open in terminal
3) copy path by command (pwd) 
4) go to settings/Emulator configurations and paste emulator path in (Emulator: Emulator Path Linux) section
5) press ctrl + alt + E then view android emulators then select device you want to boot
## variables
```
// ways to declare variales in dart 

 int days = 30;
 String name = "aashir";
 double pi = 3.14;
 bool ismale = true;
 var day = "tuesday"; // dynamic data type (var) we can assign it string/num
 const pi = 3.14;   // we can declare constants whose values donot change
 final int days = 30; // we can variable a final variable whose value doesn't change throughout program
```
## stl
write stl and press enter then IDE will generate a stateless widget here replace  widget name with your your app name in both (class and constructor)
### build 
@override 
widget build(BuildContext context){
....
}
This is very important because all UI is written under build 
## hello
```
void main() {        //we have to declare function on starting of dart program
  print('Hello, World!');  //same as python just an addition of semicolon(;)
}
```
## basic app
```
To create your first app , first runapp in main function 
void main(){
runapp(App)
```
## routes
routes are basically sequence of pages of your app it accepts key value pair same as dictonary in py. in key add path of page i.e "/" or "/home" and in value call object of main class of that page as { (context) => classname()}
## scaffold 
scaffold is property/component of widget through which you can easily add header(appbar)/fotter/drawer etc (same like html)
## child/children
child children specifies number of items of section/body/container. for single item we use child and for multiple items we use children
## difference between stateless and state full widget
Stateless widgets are the widgets that donâ€™t change i.e. they are immutable. Its appearance and properties remain unchanged throughout the lifetime of the widget. Stateful Widgets are the ones that change its properties during run-time. They are dynamic i.e., they are mutable and can be drawn multiple times within its lifetime. for statefull widget we have to call "set state( () {} )
## conditional-statements
Condition ? True : False ; </br>
it checks boolian if it is "true" then IDE executes statement after "?" and if boolian is false it executes statement which is after ":"
